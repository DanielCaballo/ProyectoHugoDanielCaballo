<h1>How is the loading process done?</h1>

<h3>Well, like this: </h3>

1. The first thing is that the Client (you) Enter the name of the web page.
2. Then **Your** pc sends the request to your router.
3. Your router sends a request to the DNS server:
    + The name you put is not the one you need.
    + He needs the ip address that is exchanged by DNS.

4. The dns Find the server you want to connect to.
5. Return the information to your router.
6. Your router sends the information to your pc.
7. And it's ready for you to see the Server information.
